# 🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction System

A **Streamlit web application** that allows users to predict the likelihood of three major diseases using machine learning models:

- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease

This project includes trained models, datasets, and interactive notebooks used to build and evaluate each disease-specific prediction system.

## 💡 Features

- Intuitive UI to select and test each disease prediction model
- Secure and lightweight models trained using real-world datasets
- Quick predictions based on user input via sliders and fields
- Model training notebooks included for transparency and reproducibility

---

## 📊 Model Training

Each disease prediction model was trained using classic ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) using relevant datasets. You can retrain models using the provided Jupyter notebooks under `/colab_files_to_train_models`.
